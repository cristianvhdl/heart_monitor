# heart_monitor
Software and firmware for the AD8232 heart rate monitor.

Web page for this project:

http://www.mikekohn.net/micro/heart_monitor.php

I originally wrote this back in 2014 and decided to move the files to github.
Basically this project is 2 parts: 1) Firmware for an MSP430G2553 chip that
communicates with an AD8232 heart rate monitor board made by SparkFun and
2) Some Objective-C / SDL software to run on a PC that gets fed data from
the MSP430G2553 displaying the data like an EKG monitor.

There is a video on the web page.
